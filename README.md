## 🤖 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup

This project uses MCP servers to enable AI assistants to interact with external services.

### GitHub MCP Server

The GitHub MCP server allows AI assistants to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests.

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed (already required for this project)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Create a token with the following permissions:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `read:packages` (Read packages)
   - `read:org` (Read org and team membership)

   To create a token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select the required scopes
   - Copy the token (you won't be able to see it again)

**Setup:**

1. Set the GitHub token as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

   Or add it to your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.):

   ```bash
   echo 'export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Restart Cursor to load the MCP configuration

The GitHub MCP server is configured in `.cursor/mcp.json` and will automatically start when Cursor connects to MCP servers. It uses `npx` to run the server, so no Docker installation is required.

### Linear MCP Server

The Linear MCP server allows AI assistants to interact with Linear issues, create new issues, and manage your Linear workspace directly from Cursor.

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed (already required for this project)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **Linear Account**: You need a Linear account to authorize the MCP server

**Setup:**

1. The Linear MCP server is already configured in `.cursor/mcp.json` and will automatically start when Cursor connects to MCP servers.

2. **Authorize with Linear:**
   - When you first use the Linear MCP server, Cursor will open a web browser
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize the connection with your Linear account
   - This is a one-time setup process

3. **Activate the Server:**
   - Press `CTRL/CMD + P` and search for `MCP: List Servers`
   - Select `Linear` from the list
   - Choose `Start Server` to initiate the connection

4. Restart Cursor if needed to load the MCP configuration

**Project Connection:**

This repository is connected to the **Command** project in Linear:

- **Linear Project URL**: [https://linear.app/ceceriforma/project/command-113a92ca8686](https://linear.app/ceceriforma/project/command-113a92ca8686)
- **Team**: Ceceriforma
- **Project ID**: `cea70c7e-066a-4e85-931c-2e5983067453`

**Usage:**

Once configured, you can use the Linear MCP server to:

- List Linear issues related to this project
- Create new Linear issues linked to the Command project
- Update existing issues
- Search for issues by various criteria

Example prompts:

- "List all issues in the Command project"
- "Create a new Linear issue for this bug in the Command project"
- "Show me all open issues in the Command project"
- "Create an issue for [feature description] and add it to the Command project"

## 🔧 Performance Optimizations

### Client-Only Components

The project uses lazy loading for non-critical client-side components to improve initial page load performance:

- **ClientOnlyComponents**: Wraps components that require browser APIs (ScrollToTop, ChatFloatingButton)
- **Dynamic Imports**: Uses Next.js dynamic imports with `ssr: false` for browser-only components
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Homepage uses Suspense for progressive loading
- **Landing Page**: All below-the-fold sections are dynamically imported with loading placeholders

### Code Splitting Strategy

- **Homepage**: `SaaSLanding` component wrapped with SSR disabled for optimal performance
- **Landing Sections**: Features, Roadmap, Pricing, Testimonials, CTA, and Footer are dynamically loaded
- **Loading States**: Placeholder divs with minimum heights prevent layout shift during loading
- **Command Interface**: Topographic background and voice components are client-only

Components like `ScrollToTop`, `ChatFloatingButton`, and landing page sections are loaded only when needed to avoid hydration issues and improve performance.
