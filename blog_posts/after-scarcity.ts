    content: `
    <p>We were all raised on the same story:</p>
    <p>Resources are scarce. Life is hard. There isn’t enough for everyone, so some people will be poor, hungry, unhoused, or buried in work forever. That’s just how it is.</p>
    <p>That story used to be true.</p>
    <p>It isn’t anymore.</p>
    <p>We’re living in a new era I call “after scarcity”: a world where, technically, we have enough food, energy, and productive capacity to guarantee every human a baseline of safety and dignity.</p>
    <p>But our systems, institutions, and mindsets are still stuck in the old world.</p>
    <p>This isn’t a sci-fi thought experiment. It’s a moral one.</p>

    <h3>1. The Lie We Still Live In</h3>
    <p>For the last couple of centuries, the core economic assumption has been simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Human wants are infinite</li>
      <li>Resources are finite</li>
      <li>Markets are the best way to allocate what little we have</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That story is the foundation of a lot of “common sense” opinions:</p>
    <blockquote>“Some people will always be poor.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“We can’t afford universal healthcare / housing / food.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“If everyone had security, nobody would work.”</blockquote>
    <p>But look at the world in 2025:</p>
    <p>We already produce enough food to feed everyone. People starve because of war, distribution, politics, and profit – not because the planet can’t grow enough.</p>
    <p>Solar and wind are now cheaper than building new fossil fuel plants in most places. Energy abundance is a technical problem that’s basically solved and a political problem that’s barely started.</p>
    <p>Automation and AI are making it possible to produce more with less human labor every year.</p>
    <p>If you zoom out, the picture is simple:</p>
    <p>We’re not running out of “stuff.”</p>
    <p>We’re running out of excuses.</p>

    <h3>2. Capitalist Realism: The Atmosphere We Breathe</h3>
    <p>The late writer Mark Fisher had a phrase I can’t stop thinking about: “capitalist realism.”</p>
    <p>His point: it’s become easier for people to imagine the end of the world than the end of our current economic system. Not because it’s good, but because it feels inevitable.</p>
    <p>Capitalist realism shows up like this:</p>
    <p><strong>Systemic problems get reframed as personal failures</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can’t afford rent? “Budget better.”</li>
      <li>Burned out? “Practice self-care.”</li>
      <li>Job market collapsing? “Reskill harder.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Any alternative sounds childish or dangerous</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universal basic income? “No one will work.”</li>
      <li>Free healthcare? “Too expensive.”</li>
      <li>Decommodified housing? “Unrealistic.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s like living inside a funhouse mirror where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Poverty looks like bad choices, not policy</li>
      <li>Homelessness looks like individual failure, not a housing market design</li>
      <li>Burnout looks like weak character, not a broken work culture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Capitalist realism is the software running in the background of our society.</p>
    <p>“After scarcity” is the patch update we refuse to install.</p>

    <h3>3. Automation: The End of Survival Work (If We Want It)</h3>
    <p>For most of history, it genuinely took huge amounts of human labor just to keep people alive:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Farming</li>
      <li>Building</li>
      <li>Transporting</li>
      <li>Manufacturing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now?</p>
    <p>Robots build cars. Algorithms trade markets. AI writes code, drafts documents, and analyzes data.</p>
    <p>Every year, more of the “necessary work” for society can be done by machines.</p>
    <p>That creates a fork in the road:</p>
    <p><strong>Dystopia route</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Productivity goes up</li>
      <li>Profits go up</li>
      <li>Workers become more precarious</li>
      <li>People still have to grind 40–60 hours just to survive</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>After scarcity route</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Productivity gains are treated as a social dividend</li>
      <li>We shorten the workweek</li>
      <li>We separate basic survival from employment</li>
      <li>People still work – but more from choice than fear</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Automation doesn’t automatically free people. It just makes it possible to free people.</p>
    <p>Whether we use it to create mass unemployment or mass security? That’s a political decision, not a technological one.</p>

    <h3>4. Mismanaged Abundance: Food and Energy</h3>
    <p>Let’s get concrete.</p>
    
    <h4>Food</h4>
    <p>The planet produces enough food to feed everyone. Yet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Millions go hungry</li>
      <li>Billions can’t afford healthy diets</li>
      <li>Tons of food gets thrown out every day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That isn’t scarcity. That’s policy. That’s logistics. That’s profit incentives.</p>
    <p>That’s what happens when food is treated first as a commodity and only second as a basic human need.</p>

    <h4>Energy</h4>
    <p>Same pattern.</p>
    <p>Solar and wind costs have crashed over the last decade. New renewables are often cheaper than new coal or gas. The tech to massively expand clean energy is here.</p>
    <p>Yet we still have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Energy poverty</li>
      <li>Fossil fuel lock-in</li>
      <li>Political systems captured by old interests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again: not a physics problem. Not a technology problem. It’s a power problem.</p>
    <p>We don’t lack the ability to move into a world of abundant clean energy. We lack the willingness to disrupt the people and systems that profit from scarcity.</p>

    <h3>5. What “Sustainable Abundance” Actually Means</h3>
    <p>“Abundance” doesn’t mean infinite consumption or everyone driving Lambos.</p>
    <p>It means this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No one is hungry</li>
      <li>No one is sleeping on the street</li>
      <li>No one is denied basic healthcare</li>
      <li>No one is shut out of education</li>
      <li>No one has to sell their entire life just to survive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And it means all of that within planetary boundaries.</p>
    <p>I call that <strong>sustainable abundance</strong>.</p>
    <p>Three core ideas:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Universal sufficiency is feasible.</strong> With the tech and productivity we have now, it is possible to guarantee everyone a baseline of comfort and safety.</li>
      <li><strong>Essentials should be unconditional.</strong> Survival shouldn’t depend on whether the market likes you this month. Housing, food, healthcare, education, and basic internet access should be treated as rights, not rewards.</li>
      <li><strong>Abundance has limits.</strong> The goal isn’t endless GDP growth. The goal is ending involuntary suffering while staying inside ecological boundaries.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This isn’t a fantasy where humans suddenly become morally perfect. It’s an engineering problem:</p>
    <p>How do we design systems so that even with flawed humans, the default outcome is no one falls through the floor?</p>

    <h3>6. AI and Governance: Tools, Not Gods</h3>
    <p>People sometimes imagine a future where AI “runs everything.” That’s not what I’m arguing for.</p>
    <p>I’m saying: if we’re serious about sustainable abundance, we’re going to need serious coordination tools.</p>
    <p>AI can help with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integrating real-time data on resources, needs, and impacts</li>
      <li>Simulating policy trade-offs before we implement them</li>
      <li>Automating boring admin so public services don’t suck</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But all of that lives inside a bigger question: <strong>Who defines the goals?</strong></p>
    <p>If AI is owned and controlled by a tiny elite, it will be used to optimize scarcity: Cut costs. Police the poor. Squeeze more profit out of everyone.</p>
    <p>If AI is built and governed publicly, it could help manage abundance: Make sure food and energy actually reach people. Track inequality in real time. Help communities plan and allocate together.</p>
    <p>The tech doesn’t save us. It magnifies whatever values we plug into it.</p>

    <h3>7. The Moral Turning Point</h3>
    <p>Here’s the real heart of the argument.</p>
    <p>At some point in history, a society crosses a line where:</p>
    <p>It can prevent most large-scale, predictable, avoidable suffering without wrecking itself.</p>
    <p>Once you cross that line, staying with the old system stops being “tragic but necessary” and becomes a choice.</p>
    <p>Right now, rich and technologically advanced countries are on the wrong side of that moral line:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People sleep outside while homes sit empty as investments</li>
      <li>People die of treatable conditions while hospitals chase profit</li>
      <li>People burn out in bullshit jobs while automation could free them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That isn’t nature. That isn’t fate. That’s design.</p>
    <p>And if it’s design, it can be redesigned.</p>

    <h3>8. After Scarcity: The One-Sentence Thesis</h3>
    <p>If you remember nothing else, remember this:</p>
    <p><strong>Once a society has the means to prevent large-scale, predictable, avoidable suffering at a reasonable cost, failing to do so is no longer an accident. It’s a moral decision.</strong></p>
    <p>We already live in an after scarcity world. We just haven’t updated the operating system.</p>
    <p>The task now is not to “dream” of abundance. It’s to take responsibility for the abundance we already have.</p>

    <h3>9. Where This Goes Next</h3>
    <p>This isn’t just theory for me.</p>
    <p>I’m writing this as someone who’s lived in scarcity and felt the system grind people down who did everything “right.”</p>
    <p>I believe we’re moving into a reset window for humanity – driven by AI, automation, climate stress, and global connectivity.</p>
    <p>We either:</p>
    <p>Use this moment to lock in a harsher, more unequal world</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>Use it to finally admit: we’re rich enough, smart enough, and connected enough to stop letting people fall through the cracks.</p>
    <p>Not because it’s “nice.”</p>
    <p>Because it’s necessary for a civilization worth inheriting.</p>
