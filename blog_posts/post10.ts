    <p>Listen up, troop. I know what you're thinking. "Can I really go from leading a fire team to leading a development team?" Short answer: Hell yes. Long answer: It takes strategy, discipline, and the same grit that got you through basic. Let me give you the SITREP on transitioning from military to tech.</p>

    <h3>The Good News: You're Already Ahead</h3>
    <p>Before we talk skills, let's talk about what you already bring to the table:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> You've led people in life-or-death situations</li>
      <li><strong>Problem-solving:</strong> You've made it work with duct tape and 550 cord</li>
      <li><strong>Learning ability:</strong> You've mastered complex systems under pressure</li>
      <li><strong>Work ethic:</strong> 16-hour days? That's Tuesday</li>
      <li><strong>Team player:</strong> You understand "leave no one behind"</li>
      <li><strong>Security clearance:</strong> Worth its weight in contractor gold</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Choosing Your Tech MOS: Pick Your Path</h3>
    <p>Tech is vast. Here's how different military backgrounds translate:</p>

    <h4>Infantry/Combat Arms → Full-Stack Development</h4>
    <p>You're used to being versatile and handling whatever comes. Full-stack is your battlefield.</p>

    <h4>Intel → Data Science/Analytics</h4>
    <p>You've analyzed patterns and made predictions. Data science is intel for business.</p>

    <h4>Signal/Comms → Network Engineering/DevOps</h4>
    <p>You've kept systems talking. DevOps keeps applications running.</p>

    <h4>Cyber → Security Engineering</h4>
    <p>This one's obvious. Your skills translate directly.</p>

    <h4>Logistics → Project Management/Systems Architecture</h4>
    <p>You've moved mountains. Now move data and coordinate sprints.</p>

    <h3>The Learning Operations Plan</h3>
    <p>Time to execute your educational assault. Here's the battle plan:</p>

    <h4>Phase 1: Basic Training (Months 1-3)</h4>
    <pre><code>// Foundation skills checklist
const basics = {
  programming: "HTML, CSS, JavaScript",
  tools: "Git, VS Code, Terminal",
  concepts: "How the internet works",
  mindset: "Computational thinking",
  practice: "Code every single day"
};</code></pre>

    <h4>Resources for Phase 1:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FreeCodeCamp:</strong> Free, structured, comprehensive</li>
      <li><strong>CS50:</strong> Harvard's intro to CS (free)</li>
      <li><strong>The Odin Project:</strong> Full-stack curriculum</li>
      <li><strong>Codecademy:</strong> Interactive learning</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Phase 2: Advanced Individual Training (Months 4-6)</h4>
    <p>Pick your specialization and go deep:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React, Vue, or Angular</li>
      <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, Python, or Java</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> SQL and NoSQL</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud:</strong> AWS, Azure, or GCP</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Phase 3: Field Exercises (Months 7-9)</h4>
    <p>Build real projects. This is your portfolio:</p>

    <pre><code>// Portfolio project ideas
const projects = [
  "Personal website (your digital dress uniform)",
  "Task manager (show CRUD operations)",
  "API project (weather, stocks, etc.)",
  "Clone a popular app (shows you can match specs)",
  "Solve a real problem (nonprofit, veteran org)"
];</code></pre>

    <h3>Leveraging Military Benefits: Your Secret Weapons</h3>

    <h4>GI Bill: Your Full-Ride Ticket</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Traditional route:</strong> CS degree at any university</li>
      <li><strong>Bootcamps:</strong> Many accept GI Bill now</li>
      <li><strong>Online programs:</strong> WGU, ASU Online, Penn State</li>
      <li><strong>Certifications:</strong> CompTIA, AWS, Cisco</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>VET TEC: The Fast Track</h4>
    <p>Provides funding for bootcamps without using GI Bill benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full tuition coverage</li>
      <li>Housing allowance</li>
      <li>Accelerated timeline</li>
      <li>High job placement rates</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>SkillBridge: Learn While You Earn</h4>

      <li>Real-world experience</li>
      <li>Often leads to job offers</li>
      <li>Microsoft, Amazon, and others participate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Networking Mission: Building Your Squad</h3>
    <p>In the military, it's about who's got your six. In tech, it's the same:</p>

    <h4>Veteran Tech Communities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operation Code:</strong> Largest veteran coding community</li>
      <li><strong>Vets Who Code:</strong> Free bootcamp for veterans</li>
      <li><strong>#VetsInTech:</strong> LinkedIn community</li>

      <li><strong>Local meetups:</strong> Search "veteran developers [your city]"</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The LinkedIn Assault</h4>
    <pre><code>// LinkedIn profile optimization
const profile = {
  headline: "Veteran transitioning to tech | Learning [stack]",
  summary: "Translate military experience to tech terms",
  experience: "Quantify your military achievements",
  skills: "Add technical skills as you learn",
  network: "Connect with veteran developers",
  activity: "Share your learning journey"
};</code></pre>

    <h3>Translating Military to Civilian: The Rosetta Stone</h3>
    <p>Stop saying "motivated soldier." Start speaking tech:</p>

    <h4>Military → Tech Translation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Led 12-person squad" →</strong> "Managed cross-functional team of 12"</li>
      <li><strong>"Responsible for $2M equipment" →</strong> "Managed $2M in technical assets"</li>
      <li><strong>"Conducted battle rhythm" →</strong> "Facilitated daily standups and sprint planning"</li>
      <li><strong>"Created SOPs" →</strong> "Developed process documentation"</li>
      <li><strong>"Mission planning" →</strong> "Project planning and execution"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Job Hunt: Conducting Reconnaissance</h3>

    <h4>Target Companies That Value Veterans</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Defense contractors:</strong> Natural transition</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise companies:</strong> Value discipline and process</li>
      <li><strong>Startups:</strong> Need your adaptability</li>
      <li><strong>Government:</strong> Understand your background</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Application Firefight</h4>
    <pre><code>// Job application strategy
const strategy = {
  quality: "10 targeted applications > 100 spray-and-pray",
  research: "Intel on company culture and tech stack",
  customize: "Tailor resume to each position",
  network: "Find veteran employees for referrals",
  follow_up: "Persistence without annoyance"
};</code></pre>

    <h3>Interview Prep: The Final Exam</h3>

    <h4>Technical Interviews: Your New PT Test</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LeetCode:</strong> Practice coding problems daily</li>
      <li><strong>System design:</strong> Learn to architect solutions</li>
      <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> STAR method for your military stories</li>
      <li><strong>Take-home projects:</strong> Treat like a mission brief</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common Veteran Mistakes to Avoid</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Over-using acronyms:</strong> They don't know what a SITREP is</li>
      <li><strong>Undervaluing yourself:</strong> Your experience has value</li>
      <li><strong>Not asking questions:</strong> Curiosity is expected</li>
      <li><strong>Being too rigid:</strong> Tech values flexibility</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>The First 90 Days: Establishing Your Position</h3>
    <p>You got the job. Now what?</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Listen and learn:</strong> You're the FNG again</li>

    <h3>The Mental Game: Overcoming Imposter Syndrome</h3>
    <p>Real talk: You'll feel like you don't belong. Here's the truth:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone googles basic stuff daily</li>
      <li>Nobody knows everything</li>
      <li>Your military experience is an asset, not a handicap</li>
      <li>You've done harder things than learning to code</li>
      <li>The tech community wants you to succeed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Resources: Your Supply Line</h3>

    </ul>

    <h4>Paid (But Worth It)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pluralsight:</strong> Deep technical training</li>
      <li><strong>Frontend Masters:</strong> Expert-led courses</li>
      <li><strong>Udemy:</strong> Wait for sales (never pay full price)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>The transition from military to tech isn't easy, but neither was basic training. You've already proven you can learn complex systems, work in teams, and execute under pressure. Now it's time to apply that same discipline to a new mission.</p>

    <p>The tech industry needs what you bring: leadership, integrity, and the ability to get shit done. So stop doubting, start coding, and remember – the only easy day was yesterday.</p>
